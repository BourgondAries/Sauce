In memory of Tormod Myrvang (xenondice).
I wished we could make more games in the future.
Rest in peace, friend. - Kevin S.

# Revival #
Luckily, all libraries were included as a binary, so it's easy to compile and run on any machine.

# To compile #
javac -cp lib/jars/jsfml.jar:lib/jars/lwjgl.jar:lib/jars/vecmath-1.5.2.jar:src/ src/game/Main.java

# To run #
java -classpath lib/jars/jsfml.jar:bin:src:lib/jars/vecmath-1.5.2.jar game.Main
